In mathematics, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
In simpler terms, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
To determine if a given number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
Here is a template code in Java to implement the algorithm:

public class PrimeChecker {

    // Function to check if a number is prime
    public static boolean isPrime(int number) {
        // XXX Check boundary Condition
		
		//XXX Check if the given number is prime (No brute force algorithm)
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // To Test the functionality
        int num = 17;
        if (isPrime(num)) {
            System.out.println(num + " is a prime number.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(num + " is not a prime number.");
        }
    }
}
