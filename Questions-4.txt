Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime numbers that multiply together to give a specific number. 
For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3, because 2 and 3 are prime numbers and 2 * 2 * 3 equals 12.

Here's a Java template code to implement the algorithm for finding the prime factorization of a given number:

import java.util.*;

public class PrimeFactorization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int number = 24;
        List<Integer> primeFactors = primeFactorization(number);
        System.out.println("Prime factorization of " + number + ": " + primeFactors);
    }

    public static List<Integer> primeFactorization(int number) {
        List<Integer> primeFactors = new ArrayList<>();
        // XXX Your code for prime factorization algorithm goes here
        // Iterate through possible prime factors and divide the number
        
        return primeFactors;
    }
}
